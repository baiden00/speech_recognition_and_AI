# Speech Recognition and AI


This project explores speech recognition and AI. It includes speech to text functions, user-issued command functions through speech, and responsive actions by the AI. Some of these include asking the AI what it's name is and the AI responding, saying common phrases such as "Hello" or "Hi" and receiving a response from the AI,  or issuing commands such as searching google and the program automatically opening a google browser to search for what has been requested.
